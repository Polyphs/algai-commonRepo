2. **Trial → Paid conversion** (target: 35-40%)
3. **NPS score** (target: >50)

## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO WATCH

If you see these, pause and reassess:

1. **Conversion <30%** → Pricing too high or messaging wrong
2. **Churn >10%/month** → Product not solving real problem
3. **NPS <40** → Users not enthusiastic, won't refer
4. **Zero press mentions** → Story not resonating, need pivot
5. **Low LinkedIn engagement** → Professional audience not interested

## FINAL ADVICE

**Focus ruthlessly on the critical priorities.** Everything in 🔴 CRITICAL must be done this week. Everything in 🟠 HIGH should be done this month. Everything else can wait.

**Your biggest risk is not moving fast enough.** Competitors will copy if you succeed. File trademarks now. Launch products fast. Build community early.

**Your biggest opportunity is the professional market shift.** 500M professionals vs 100M ADHD adults = 5x larger addressable market. This changes everything.

**Let ADHD guide design, not marketing.** Use ADHD lens to make products simple, focused, clear. But sell to everyone who wants those qualities (which is everyone).
