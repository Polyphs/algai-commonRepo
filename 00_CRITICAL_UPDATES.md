# ALGAI Strategy: Critical Updates & Clarifications
**MANDATORY READ BEFORE REVIEWING OTHER DOCUMENTS | February 2026**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGES FROM INITIAL ANALYSIS

The following updates correct major assumptions in the initial strategic documents. **These clarifications are authoritative and override any conflicting information in documents 01-04.**

---

## 1. PRODUCT NAMING CONVENTION ✅

### **USER-FACING NAMES** (Public, Marketing, App Stores)
Products are named based on **meaningful acronyms** describing the job to be done:

| Product | Public Name | Meaning | Price |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Task Management | **OT²** | **O**n **T**op of **T**ime | $2/mo |
| Career Clarity | **JOYD** | **J**ob **o**f **Y**our **D**reams | $7/mo |
| Screen Time | **SWAYT** | **S**top **W**hiling **A**way **Y**our **T**ime | $1.79/mo |

**Why This Matters:**
- Users see: "OT²" "JOYD" "SWAYT" (memorable, meaningful)
- NOT: "Coral" "Kelp" "Reef" (these are internal only)

---

### **INTERNAL NAMES** (Engineering, GitHub, Folders)
Marine ecosystem names are **internal company lingo only**:

| Internal Codename | Public Product | GitHub Repo | App Package |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Coral** | OT² | `algai/coral` | `app.algai.ot2` |
| **Kelp** | JOYD | `algai/kelp` | `app.algai.joyd` |
| **Swayt** | SWAYT | `algai/swayt` | `app.getswayt` |
| **Reef** | ALGAI Platform | `algai/reef-platform` | N/A (shared) |

**Why This Separation:**
- **Marine theme** = internal metaphor for ecosystem thinking
- **Acronyms** = external branding for user clarity
- Example: GitHub shows "algai/coral" but App Store shows "OT² - Task Management"

---

## 2. TARGET MARKET CORRECTION ⚠️

### **WRONG ASSUMPTION (Original Documents):**
❌ "ADHD adults are the primary target market"
❌ "100M+ ADHD users globally"
❌ "ADHD productivity apps market"

### **CORRECT POSITIONING:**

**Primary Target Market:** **PROFESSIONALS OF ALL TYPES**

Specific segments:
1. **Entrepreneurs** (solo founders, startup teams)
2. **Executives** (C-suite, VPs, directors)
3. **Managers** (team leads, project managers)
4. **Innovators** (product designers, researchers)
5. **Work Hustlers** (multiple jobs, side hustles, remote workers)
6. **Coaches & Coachees** (executive coaching, life coaching clients)
7. **Students** (graduate, professional development)
8. **Specialists** (consultants, freelancers, domain experts)
9. **Small Teams** (15-20 people in R&D, innovation labs)

**Market Size:** 500M+ knowledge workers globally (NOT just ADHD subset)

---

### **ADHD = Design Persona, NOT Target Market**

**What ADHD Actually Means for ALGAI:**

ADHD is a **UX design framework** to evaluate product decisions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ADHD AS DESIGN EVALUATION CRITERIA                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│  Question to Ask During Design:                     │
│                                                      │
│  ✅ Is this page simple? (No cognitive overload)    │
│  ✅ Does this page distract? (Visual hierarchy)     │
│  ✅ Are colors meaningful? (Not arbitrary)          │
│  ✅ Does this task focus on ONE thing?              │
│  ✅ Does the app lead without "what next?" moments? │
│  ✅ Can users recover from mistakes easily?         │
│  ✅ Is feedback immediate and clear?                │
│                                                      │
│  If product works for ADHD persona →                │
│  It works BETTER for everyone                       │
│                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**ADHD Persona = Accessibility Lens**

Similar to how:
- **Wheelchair accessibility** makes buildings better for everyone (parents with strollers, elderly, delivery workers)
- **ADHD-friendly design** makes apps better for everyone (busy executives, stressed parents, distracted workers)

**Marketing Implication:**
- ❌ DON'T SAY: "Built for ADHD users"
- ✅ DO SAY: "Built for humans who get distracted" or "Designed for focus in a chaotic world"

---

## 3. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SHIFT

### **UPDATED COMPETITIVE SET:**

**Original (Incorrect):**
- Tiimo, Focus Bear, Inflow (ADHD-specific apps)
- Market: "ADHD productivity tools"

**Corrected:**
- **Todoist, Notion, Asana** (general task management)
- **LinkedIn Premium, Teal, Huntr** (career tools)
- **Freedom, One Sec, Screen Time** (distraction management)
- Market: "Productivity tools for professionals"

**Key Difference:**
- You're competing with **mainstream productivity** (broader market, more competition)
- But differentiated by: **Privacy + Socratic + Marine impact** (not ADHD focus)

---

## 4. UNIQUE POSITIONING (UPDATED)

### **OLD USP:**
"Privacy-first ADHD productivity platform with marine conservation"

### **NEW USP:**
"Privacy-first productivity platform for professionals, using Socratic coaching and funding ocean conservation"

**The Four Pillars (Unchanged Core, Refined Messaging):**

1. **Privacy First** → "Your data stays on your device"
   - Appeals to: Security-conscious professionals, privacy advocates, international users

2. **Socratic Coaching** → "We ask questions, you find answers"
   - Appeals to: Executives, coaches, self-directed learners, innovators

3. **Marine Conservation** → "Your productivity funds ocean restoration"
   - Appeals to: Mission-driven professionals, eco-conscious consumers, Gen Z/Millennials

4. **Global Accessibility** → "$2-9/month, not $20-50"
   - Appeals to: Students, freelancers, global south professionals, small teams

---

## 5. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY (UPDATED)

### **Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Launch OT² + SWAYT**

**Target Audiences (REVISED):**

1. **Privacy-Conscious Professionals**
   - Tech workers, security researchers, journalists
   - Channels: HackerNews, r/privacy, r/selfhosted
   - Message: "Local-only data, no surveillance"

2. **Productivity Nerds**
   - Early adopters of productivity tools
   - Channels: ProductHunt, r/productivity, IndieHackers
   - Message: "Socratic coaching, not prescriptive hacks"

3. **Busy Professionals** (NEW)
   - Entrepreneurs, managers juggling multiple priorities
   - Channels: LinkedIn, professional communities
   - Message: "Clarity in chaos. $2/month."

**REMOVED:**
- ❌ ADHD influencer partnerships
- ❌ ADHD patient advocacy groups
- ❌ "ADHD-friendly" positioning

**ADDED:**
- ✅ LinkedIn thought leadership (executive audience)
- ✅ Productivity podcasts (broader professional appeal)
- ✅ Small business/startup communities

---

### **Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Launch JOYD**

**Product Name:** ~~DreamJob~~ → **JOYD** (Job of Your Dreams)

**Target Audiences:**
1. **Career Transitioners** (bootcamp grads, career switchers)
2. **Burned Out Professionals** (seeking meaningful work)
3. **Executive Coaching Clients** (working with coaches)
4. **Existing OT² Users** (cross-sell: clarity → career fit)

**Positioning:**
- NOT: "Find a job faster"
- YES: "Discover what you actually want" (Socratic self-discovery)

---

## 6. MARKETING MESSAGING (UPDATED)

### **AVOID (ADHD-Specific Language):**
❌ "Built for ADHD brains"
❌ "ADHD-friendly design"
❌ "If you have ADHD, this is for you"
❌ "Executive function support"

### **USE (Universal Professional Language):**
✅ "Built for humans in a distracted world"
✅ "Simple, focused, intentional design"
✅ "No cognitive overload"
✅ "Focus on what matters, not what's urgent"
✅ "Designed for deep work and clear thinking"

### **WHEN TO MENTION ADHD:**
Only in **UX/design context**, never as target market:
- ✅ "Designed using accessibility principles (including ADHD considerations)"
- ✅ "If it works for distracted professionals, it works for everyone"
- ❌ "For people with ADHD" (too narrow, medicalizes)

---

## 7. BRAND ARCHITECTURE (CLARIFIED)

### **Company Brand: ALGAI**
- Pronounced: "AL-guy" (like algae)
- Meaning: Algorithm + AI + Algae (marine)
- Represents: The platform/ecosystem
- Used in: Company name, domain (algai.io), app store publisher

### **Product Brands: Acronyms (User-Facing)**
- **OT²** - On Top of Time (task management)
- **JOYD** - Job of Your Dreams (career clarity)
- **SWAYT** - Stop Whiling Away Your Time (screen time)

### **Internal Codenames: Marine (Engineering Only)**
- **Coral** = OT² codebase
- **Kelp** = JOYD codebase
- **Swayt** = SWAYT codebase (same as public name)
- **Reef** = Shared platform/infrastructure

### **Portfolio Brand: Algai Reef (Optional Marketing)**
- "Explore the Algai Reef" (ecosystem of tools)
- Used in: Marketing site, bundle messaging
- NOT used in: Individual app branding

---

## 8. KELP FOUNDATION (UNCHANGED NAME, CLARIFIED SCOPE)

**Foundation Name:** Kelp Foundation (KEEP - marine theme works for nonprofit)

**Relationship to JOYD:**
- JOYD is the user-facing product name
- "Kelp" codebase is internal engineering name
- Kelp Foundation is separate nonprofit entity (marine conservation)

**Why This Works:**
- Foundation can have marine name (aligns with mission)
- Product can have acronym name (user clarity)
- Internal codename links them (Kelp product → Kelp Foundation)

---

## 9. UPDATED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### **Your True Moats (Refined):**

1. **Privacy Architecture** (Unchanged)
   - Local-only data processing
   - Appeals to: Professionals handling sensitive information (lawyers, doctors, executives)

2. **Socratic Methodology** (Unchanged)
   - Questions, not prescriptions
   - Appeals to: Self-directed professionals, coaches, executives

3. **Marine Conservation** (Unchanged)
   - Performance-based donations (user success → ocean impact)
   - Appeals to: Mission-driven professionals

4. **Professional Design** (NEW FRAMING)
   - Simple, focused, distraction-free (informed by ADHD accessibility lens)
   - Appeals to: Busy professionals who value clarity over features

5. **Global Pricing** (Unchanged)
   - $2-9/mo vs $20-50/mo competitors
   - Appeals to: Students, freelancers, global south, small teams

---

## 10. TRADEMARK STRATEGY (UPDATED FILINGS)

### **Priority 1 (File Immediately):**
1. ✅ **ALGAI** (word mark, Classes 09, 42)
2. ✅ **Algai Reef** (word + design, portfolio brand)
3. ✅ **Freedom→Focus→Work→Review** (method mark)

### **Priority 2 (After MVP Validation):**
4. ⏸️ **OT²** (stylized logo + word mark)
5. ⏸️ **JOYD** (word mark) — ⚠️ **NEW, replacing DreamJob**
6. ⏸️ **SWAYT** (word mark)

### **DO NOT FILE:**
❌ **Coral, Kelp** (internal names, not public-facing trademarks)

---

## 11. REVISED TARGET METRICS (YEAR 1)

### **OLD (ADHD-Focused Market):**
- 5,000 paying users (from 100M ADHD adults globally)
- Focus on neurodivergent communities

### **NEW (Professional Market):**
- **10,000 paying users** (from 500M+ professionals globally)
- Focus on privacy-conscious, mission-driven, productivity-seeking professionals

**Why Higher Target:**
- Broader market (500M vs 100M)
- Less medical stigma (not positioning as ADHD tool)
- Wider appeal (universal design vs niche market)

### **Revenue Targets (Updated):**
- Year 1: 10,000 users × $5/mo avg = **$50K MRR** ($600K ARR)
- Year 2: 50,000 users × $6/mo avg = **$300K MRR** ($3.6M ARR)

---

## 12. INTERNAL COMPANY LINGO (FOR REFERENCE)

Use these terms consistently in internal docs, code, meetings:

### **Product Architecture:**
- **Reef Platform** = Shared Flutter + Supabase infrastructure
- **Coral** = OT² codebase (`algai/coral` repo)
- **Kelp** = JOYD codebase (`algai/kelp` repo)
- **Swayt** = SWAYT codebase (`algai/swayt` repo)

### **Framework:**
- **Freedom→Focus→Work→Review** = Our methodology (trademark this)
- **Socratic Coaching** = AI questioning approach
- **ADHD Persona** = Design evaluation criteria (NOT target market)

### **Foundation:**
- **Kelp Foundation** = Nonprofit for ocean conservation
- **Ocean Impact** = Marine conservation donations

### **Pricing:**
- **Freemium** = Free trial (14 days) → Paid
- **Standalone** = OT² $2, JOYD $7, SWAYT $1.79
- **Bundle** = All three for $9/mo (20% savings)
- **Annual** = 17% discount (e.g., OT² $20/yr vs $24)

---

## 13. CRITICAL DOCUMENT CORRECTIONS
